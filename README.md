Tweeter is a single page application, simulating the functionality of twitter for you: the user!

You are able to post tweets, and tweets are dynamically posted and pulled from a database hosted in memory. There are all kinds of nifty features, such as responsive design, contextual buttons and such. Try it out and see for yourself!
